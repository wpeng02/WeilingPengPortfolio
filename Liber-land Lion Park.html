                <br>
                <p>The story is about an old man Denis building a wildlife park, Liber-land Lion Park, for the rescued lions. The story has five chapters, each unfolding from the perspective of a lion character who is rescued by Denis and the veterinarian Jas to the lion park. As the story progresses, the zoo gradually becomes a paradise for wildlife.</p>

                        <p><b>Background Story:</b> During Dennis's service, he once attended a battle in which he parachuted to a grassland deviated from the original landing point. He encountered a wild lion pride and miraculously formed a friendship with the lions. However, the war spread and the lions suffered heavy casualties. Feeling extremely guilty, Denis retired after the war and returned to the former military base which was abandoned. He found the young lion king Sargon and his pack, who might be the descendent of the previous lion pack. The group was struggling to live in the destroyed grassland, so Denis spent his life fortune to buy this place and began to build a safe place for the lions to live.</p>

After graduating from college, Jaz accidentally saw the zoo veterinary recruitment posted by Denis, so she moved to the zoo that was still under construction. Denis is the opposite of Jas's father, and his silent concern for the lions and Jaz makes her feel warm. The zoo gradually becomes the home of Jaz, and Denis is like a father figure to her.</p>
